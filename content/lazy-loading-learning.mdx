Hi! I'm going to talk about how I learn new things effectively. I see a lot of people wasting time in courses and coding along with YouTube videos and wanted to share how I personally go about learning.

## Tutorial Hell

Tutorial hell is where you just keep following tutorials without building things on your own. You just code along the tutorial and end up learning nothing.

## How to not get into tutorial hell

> Just build stuff

This is very easy to say but very hard to actually do. It can be very overwhelming and scary. People generally don't know where to start, or even how to start.

### Lazy loading learning

Lazy loading in software development is a strategy to identify non critical resources and loading them only when needed. It's used to optimize applications and improve speed and efficiency.

This exact technique can be used to learn new things! Let's understand this with an example.

Say you want to build a website for a charity you like where people can donate online. You already know how to build frontends with [React](https://reactjs.org/) but have no idea how backends work and how to implement online payments. So you setup a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project and start with what you know, which is the frontend. You make a pretty UI and now you need a database to store users. In the lazy loading approach, you will search how to use databases with Next.js. And sooner rather than later you'll come across [Prisma](https://prisma.io/). So you set up a database, and follow the getting started guide of Prisma with Next.js. You start using it and realize its not that hard. You get stuck, you search it, you fix/implement it. Learning things when needed. You knew [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) was good for payments but had no idea how to use it. So you follow the getting started guide and implement payments pretty quick. learning things when needed.

This is the whole workflow of lazy loading learning.

### Tips

Here's some tips to get you started.

- Start with what you know.
- Research about the tools you can use to do what you want and pick one.
- Look at the getting started guide or examples on how to use that tool. It's important not to spend a lot of time on docs, and just start building.
- Search things when you get stuck.

Hi! Today I'm gonna talk about my daily developer workflow and all the tools I use to set up a productive enviroment for coding. I think having a nice looking terminal and some tools to save time are really helpful to keep you productive in daily coding sessions.

### Operating System

I use Windows and it's pretty much unusable for programming. Thankfully Microsoft understood that and made [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) also known as `WSL` in short. It lets you run a Linux distribution inside of Windows.

I use [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/), it's the default distribution that is installed with `WSL`. Ubuntu is really simple to use and has a huge community so getting support is very easy. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to start using Linux and get familiar with basic Linux commands.

### Shell

Ubuntu by default comes with the bash shell. Bash is great but I personally use find it harder to customize. That is why I use [Z shell](https://zsh.org/), more commonly known as `zsh`. To manage my `zsh` configuration, I use [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), it has a huge community and makes it trivial to install and use plugins.

I used to use [fish](https://fishshell.com/) shell which also a great shell. It has very sensible defaults and comes with a lot of cool features like autosuggestions, tab completions, etc. out of the box without the need to set up anything. The only problem with fish is that it is not `POSIX-compliant`. [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) is a set of standards that define how to develop programs for UNIX based operating systems. So in fish, things like bash scripts do not work. They have their own scripting language.

`zsh` on the other hand is fully POSIX-compliant. This is why I switched to `zsh` and I'm quite happy with it so far.

### Prompt

I use [Starship](https://starship.rs/) for my prompt and it is AMAZING. Written in [Rust](https://rustlang.org/), Starship is a minimal, highly customizable and super fast prompt. The default look of it is really good but literally every little detail is customizable to your liking. 

The configuration file for Starship lives in `~/.config/starship.toml`. Here's my `starship.toml`.

```toml:~/.config/starship.toml
